This is my learning and aggregation space on GitHub.
It has been guided by a [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and insights from [Amber Thomas](https://proquestionasker.github.io). There is a sprinkling of a very helpful [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) too.
