# Portfolio

## Introduction

This is my [ePortfolio](http://wikieducator.org/Sport_Informatics_and_Analytics/ePortfolio#Some_Background_Information) learning and aggregation space.

I started to host my ePortfolio here in March 2017. My first attempts at a GitHub repository for my portfolio were nurtured by a [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and a very helpful [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).
