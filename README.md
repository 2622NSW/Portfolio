# Portfolio

## Introduction

This is my [ePortfolio](http://wikieducator.org/Sport_Informatics_and_Analytics/ePortfolio#Some_Background_Information) learning and aggregation space.

It is my response to [Joi Ito](https://civic.mit.edu/blog/mstem/joi-itos-9-principles-of-the-media-lab)'s proposal that _learning_ is what we do to ourselves.

I started to host my ePortfolio here in March 2017. My first attempts at a GitHub repository for my portfolio were nurtured by a [GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and a very helpful [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

I am hopeful that this repository explifies Stephen Downes' [2016](https://www.slideshare.net/Downes/disruptive-innovations-in-learning) model of work and learning, namely:  
>**Sharing** - creating linked documents, data, and objects in a distributed network.  
>**Contributing** - employ social networking applications of the Web to facilitae group discussion.  
>**Co-creating** - work through networks that facilitate co-operative group work toward common goals.
